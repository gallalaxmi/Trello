<h1> Selenium, Rest Assured Framework</h1>
<p>
The Selenium automation Framework is a code structure that makes code maintenance easy and efficient. Without frameworks, users may place the “code” and “data” at the same location which is neither reusable nor readable. Frameworks produce beneficial outcomes like increased code reusability, higher portability, reduced cost of script maintenance, better code readability, etc.
